        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Md Ashickur Rahman. I am from Rajshahi a city in
          Bangladesh. For my parent’s jobs, I got a chance to move around at an
          early age. I have spent my childhood in different cities. But, the
          longest time of my childhood I have spent in a city called Sylhet.
          This is a place with a ton of breathtaking sceneries. The city is full
          of green because of the tea gardens. Overall, it is a beautiful place
          to live.

            I used to live in a family of four people with my parents and
            younger brother. It is a pretty small family if I compare it with
            other families in my country, but, we are a happy family. My parents
            were kind and helpful all of my life and that is the reason behind
            who I am now. I’ve always had a friendly relationship with my
            parents and my younger brother. Now, after living here in Canada for
            a few months, I realized the importance of having a
            family-especially when they are loving and kind.

          I have been fascinated by computers since my childhood. The first day
          I got my computer was a whole new experience for me. I still feel
          happy when I remember that day. When I got transferred to the school,
          I learned about programming languages I got excited. It was an amazing
          moment for me. From that day on, I wanted to learn how-to programming.
          I tried to learn some of the hardest programming languages without
          knowing anything about them. I was alone and there was no one to help
          me with my problems. Then I quit learning programming languages. After
          coming here, I got to know about the Software Development Program at
          MITT. I did some research and was happy to see the course outline and
          decided to get admitted to this program as I always wanted to learn to
          interact with computers.

          Talking about my hobbies - music and traveling are the things I enjoy
          the most. I love to play guitar, especially in nature. I love to go
          solo traveling as well. Music while traveling gives me some kind of
          joy that makes me calm and wise. Most of the life-changing realization
          I got from traveling and music. I also love to go hiking, long drive,
          rock climbing, and cycling.
