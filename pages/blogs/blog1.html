      <h1>SSL, TSL & HTTPS</h1>
      <p>
        SSL means Secure Sockets Layer. It is the standard technology to keep an
        internet connection secure. SSL secures data that is sent between two
        systems. It prevents criminals from reading and modifying any
        information and potential documents transferred. For example shopping
        websites and browsers or servers to servers. SSL helps to secure
        information that is shared between them. SSL makes sure that any data
        transferring between sites or two systems are secured and remains
        possible to read. This standard uses encryption algorithms to scramble
        data in transit and prevent hackers from accessing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        TLS is an updated version of SSL. It is more secure as it has some
        special features than the other. TLS and SSL are not interoperable, but
        TLS offers more strong and deep security when transferring data in
        between servers or systems. It offers such protocols to the client and
        server to authenticate each other and negotiate security keys before
        transmitting any data.
      </p>

      <p>
        Encryption is the method of scrambling data to maintain their privacy.
        It helps to make information understandable only to authorized parties.
        Technically, encryption is the way of converting readable text to
        incomprehensible text. Encryption is important because it helps to
        maintain minimum privacy and makes data useful only to authorized users.
        It helps to protect private information and can enhance the security
        between client apps and servers.
      </p>

      <p>
        HTTP and HTTPs also take part to make secure websites. The difference
        between these two Hyper Text Transfer Protocol will be clearer by this
        example if someone just browses the web to surf around, HTTP is fine.
        But if someone is logging into his or her bank account or entering
        credit card information in a payment page it is important that the URL
        for that page must be HTTPs.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think the most sensitive information are bank account numbers, social
        security numbers, pin numbers, credit card numbers, passwords, and more.
        To be secured all the time we have to take care of our personal
        information as I mentioned in those examples before. We must know all
        the information related to them and track them regularly. For example,
        we can use a different password for different websites than saving
        passwords on websites we can memorize them or note them manually using
        paper, and, a notebook.
