        so stressful sometime. In this paragraph, I want to share some tips for
        relaxing and enjoyable travel. There are very few people do not like to

      <p>
        I travel a lot. Each year I try to leave my comfort zone at-least for a
        month. In 2018, I have traveled for four months in a row. Those four
        months was a lesson to me. I have learned from my mistakes. After that
        tour my travel strategies have changed a lot. Here are some facts that
        can change anyone's travel experience:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          While packing it is important to be cautious about what we are
          packing. Avoiding unnecessary stuffs is a good practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Less planning is tough to do before visiting a new place, but if you
          plan less you will be less stressed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Travelling for long period of time can be overwhelming. It is better
          to relax and take some time for yourself while travelling.
        </li>
        <li>
          I know this is weird, but always try to keep a smartphone with you and
          make sure the internet is working.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These are just some of my personal experience and must to do while I am
        on a tour. We travel for works, enjoyments, lessons and many more.
        Whatever the reason is but travelling is always special. For a enjoyable
        journey and to make it better and to avoid unexpected circumstances
        these are some DON'T of travelling:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>DON'T use wire transfer or cash.</li>
        <li>DON'T let your phone roam.</li>
        <li>DON'T talk politics.</li>
        <li>
          Not every country is a free country, and not everyone is tolerant of
          free speech. It is wise to avoid political gossip while on the road.
          DON'T spent much time in hotel rooms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We all have different opinions, preferences and priorities. Our plan
        regarding travel can be different from each other, but this strategy
        guide can help to achieve a harassment free, relaxed travel experience.
